Goals:
    - Weapon detection
    - Public saftey
    - Threat recognition
    - Fewer crime rates    
    - Notify people around the area
    - Notify the police/authorities
    - Detect if person is hostile

Outline:
    Create a product that analyzes pictures/videos for dangers/threats (Knives/guns/other weapons) in public areas. If we have enough time we can also analyze the person for behavior that may indicate a threat.
    1st iteration - user uploads images to detect threats, returns image with objects detected and a message about what objects were found (if any)
    Time Permitting:
    2nd iteration - video upload with same output as image upload; further extension could be live feed

Roadblocks:
            - Notifying people in area also reaches perpetrator/threat
            - Identify correct threatening situations (avoid mis-detection/mis-classification)\
            - Focus on avoiding missidentifications
            - Authorization for reporting to authorities
            - Even if their is a object present, what if its a cops gun?

Tech Stack:
    - Yolov5 (CV model)
    - html/css/javascript
    - Flask (python for web development)

    Data Collection:
        - Variety within each class
        - Include images that do not contain threats
        - 2D vs 3D (for non-threat vs threat)
        - What about 3D things that are not threats (nerf guns, toy swords, etc.)?

Steps:
    1. Gathering the data for the AI
    2. Teaching the AI
    3. Test the AI and use more data based on inaccuracy
    4. Troubleshoot problems
    5. Creating the front-end website
    6. Intigration of back-end into website
    7. Peer feedback
    8. Finalize product
    9. Deploy
